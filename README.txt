Interactive program for showing Canny edge detection.

Based on OpenCV wrapper EmguCV. Can do circle detection too but it's mighty slow.

Written in C#/.net using Visual Studio 2015

Usage:
  Change the variable `filePath` (MainWindow.xaml.cs:65) to point to the image you want to do testing on.
  Build and run.
